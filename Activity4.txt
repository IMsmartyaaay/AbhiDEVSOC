I generally use Zomato when I am hungry. I open the app, choose either my favourite cuisine type or something from a list of suggested restaurants. Upon choosing the restaurant, I get a list of products I can purchase, but commonly purchased foods are shown at the top. I search for other stuff in the search bar and combo offers with those products become visible. After selecting all the required items, I select the pay option. I am redirected to the payment server wherein I get the amount and credentials verified. The estimated time of arrival is shown afterwards with the live location of the rider carrying the food.

Zomato obviously gives a vast list of foods I can enjoy and looks at popular recommendations. The payment system is quick and efficient. However, the live location tracker is sometimes not very accurate. Also, there is not a centralised menu where I can look at each dish. There should be a feature where restaurants and customers can provides inputs on popular and new dishes. The interface all in all though is relatively user friendly and appealing to the eye
