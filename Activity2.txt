1. The page is full of many hyperlinks. The background is plain white and there are too many empty spaces, which are even more conspicuous due to the small font size of the main text. The combination of blue and purple which might not appeal to the viewer. However, a lot of this can be excused since it appears to be the portal of some organisation, not a commercial website.

2. Again, while this has a decent level of formatting, the font is too simple for this webpage. The task bar at the top has not been built properly. There is too much text, and the list is extremely long and monotonous. 

3. The complete page is filled up with countless hyperlinks. The colour scheme is extremely inconsistent. Images are not properly formatted. The font seems to change from one piece to another. The number of pictures makes the website reasonably unattractive.

4. The same image was been pasted again and again which makes it even more annoying than a repeated bullet point. Also, blue on top of blue does not really go well. The top of the screen has serious formatting issues.

5. The shop logo has been copied eight times in a row. And only two colours have been used in the entire space, black and pink. Formatting could have made the bottom of the screen look better.
